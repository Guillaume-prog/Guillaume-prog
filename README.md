## Hey y'all, I'm Guillaume !

I'm currently an engineering student in robotics and I love to code on the side.

### Different code galleries

I enjoy coding just about anything, although I do prefer web development. I've tried my hand at discord_bots, android apps, python snippets, hardware drivers and more ! Here's where you can find my different projects :

- Wanna see the projects I do for school ? Check out 🧑‍🏫 [Guillaume's Upssitech Days](https://github.com/gui-upssitech)
- I'm really invested in web development ! Comme look at the websites I make in 🌐 [Guillaume's Web World](https://github.com/gui-websites)
- I'm working on a big project at the moment for my school, come have a look at [SuperEDT](https://github.com/UPSSI-DEV)
- For anything else you can lurk around here and see the random stuff I come up with.
